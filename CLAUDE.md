# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **living documentation repository** that provides comprehensive comparisons and analysis of AI coding agents. The documentation is designed to be maintained and updated by AI agents to keep it current with the rapidly evolving ecosystem.

**Definition of Coding Agent:**

A coding agent is any agent that is mainly intended for writing code and targeted at developers. This EXCLUDES:
- Pure vibe coding agents
- Pure chat agents
- Integrated platforms aimed at creating full-stack apps including deployments

## Agent Categories

All coding agents are categorized into six types. See **TEMPLATES.md** for the exact category names and emojis to use.

## Pricing Models

All coding agents follow one of two pricing models. See **TEMPLATES.md** for the exact pricing model names and emojis to use.

## Required Information for Each Agent

When documenting or updating agents, always include:

**Basic Information:**
- Agent name
- Organization/Developer
- Website URL
- GitHub repository URL (if open-source)
- GitHub star count (see **TEMPLATES.md** for format)
- Open source status (see **TEMPLATES.md** for format)
- Agent category/type (see **TEMPLATES.md** for categories)
- Introduction date (see **TEMPLATES.md** for date format)

**Project Context:**
- Related tools from the same maker
- Whether it's a standalone project or part of a larger ecosystem
- Links to related offerings

**Model Access:**
- Which AI models are supported (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, other providers)
- How models are accessed (native API, aggregator, BYOK, managed)
- Default model if applicable

**Pricing:**
- Pricing model (see **TEMPLATES.md** for format)
- All pricing tiers with monthly/annual costs in USD (see **TEMPLATES.md** for table format)
- Links to official pricing pages

**Key Features:**
- Notable capabilities or differentiators
- Special modes or functionality
- Integration capabilities (MCP, Spec Kit, etc.)

**Release Information:**
- General availability date or beta status
- Major version milestones

## Documentation Templates

**IMPORTANT:** Always read **TEMPLATES.md** before updating or creating documentation.

That file contains standardized tokens and templates for:
- Agent category names and emojis
- Pricing model indicators
- Open source status formats
- GitHub star count formatting
- Compatibility indicators
- Date formats
- Model provider and model names
- Status indicators
- Pricing table formats
- Link formats

Using these templates ensures consistency across all documentation.

## Update Instructions

For detailed instructions on how to update the documentation, see **UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md**.

That file contains:
- Complete checklist of data points to verify and update
- Research methodology and information sources
- Update process and workflow
- Consistency requirements

## Documentation Standards

**Language:**
- Use British English spelling throughout (e.g., "optimise" not "optimize", "organisation" not "organization", "colour" not "color")

**All other formatting standards:**
- See **TEMPLATES.md** for all formatting rules, including:
  - Markdown formatting rules
  - Table formatting and alignment
  - Date formats
  - Compatibility indicators
  - Link formats

## Future Plans

The documentation is currently published as GitHub Markdown files, but may later transition to a static website with additional functionality such as:
- Sortable and filterable tables
- Dynamic pricing comparisons
- Real-time updates
- Interactive compatibility matrices
